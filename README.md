## This example is to illustrate the use of Sagemaker Studio

We create a simple notebook which pulls files from S3 to a local directory (local to session).
Then we train a model on this data.

Beyond this, we show how to set up a training job, and we ensure that the files are rewritten to S3 in a form which is conducive to the training job.
